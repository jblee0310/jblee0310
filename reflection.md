#Reflection 
##Challenges
One challenge I had was getting the ultrasonic sensor to work precisely. 
With the delays that was in my code, my serial monitor printed the distance that was detected by the sensor few seconds ago. 
Therefore, my fan turned on few seconds after I went close to the sensor, which was a problem.
I had to reduce the delay to fix this issue. 
Wire management was difficult, and took a long time to shorten the wires and connect it. 
##What I want to Learn More 
A topic I want to learn is doing the keypads.
